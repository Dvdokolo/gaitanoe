Industry awards can give an indication of an agency's standing within the real estate industry. Gaitanoe has received awards in multiple categories over the past few years, including most recently the National Awards for Excellence 'Best Real-Estate Company of the year' in 2023.

   <span class="font-bold"> Market Share</span><br>
The benefit of choosing a local area expert comes down to the finer details of their marketing campaign. Gaitanoe sales agents are local area experts who can communicate what you love about the area and its community. As well, Gaitanoe sales agents have an extensive list of potential buyers who missed out on purchasing other property in the area they could introduce to your property.

   <span class="font-bold">Days on Market</span><br>
When selling your property, it’s essential to choose an agent who can get you the best result in a reasonable time frame. Along with the inconvenience caused by a drawn-out sales campaign, in most cases there is also downward pressure placed on the eventual selling price. Regardless of whether a property is being sold by private treaty or auction, Gaitanoe conduct intensive sales campaigns designed to generate the maximum levels of interest and competition from buyers. This delivers our sellers the best possible result in the shortest possible time frame.

   <span class="font-bold"> Auction Clearance</span><br>
Gaitanoe’s auction clearance rate is consistently above the Sydney average and often reaches a 100% auction clearance rate. Why is this? Gaitanoe agents are highly trained in the auction process and have an intensive strategy of communication and presentations designed to drive buyer interest and build anticipation in the lead up to auction day.

   <span class="font-bold"> Buyer Database</span><br>
Every agent will tell you that they have a database of buyers. The key question you need to consider is how the agent interacts with their buyers. You need to ensure that the agent you choose regularly interacts with the buyers on their database through a variety of communication channels. At Gaitanoe Properties we combine email alerts with phone calls to all our buyers, whose property requirements match your property. This email currently receives a 67% open rate in comparison to the industry standard of 18%, which directly translates to more potential buyers considering your property as soon as it is listed.

   <span class="font-bold"> Campaign Strategy</span><br>
When you choose to sell with Gaitanoe you are not just listing with one agent but with an entire team of professionals dedicated to excellence. The key to achieving a successful sales result is to ensure that your property is exposed to the maximum possible potential buyers. Our goal, like yours, is to achieve the best possible price for your property. Our commitment to excellence ensures that more than 75% of our sales achieve a result within or above our estimated price range. The time a property sits on the market directly correlates to the result achieved and currently properties listed with Gaitanoe spend on average less than half the time on the market than our competitors.
